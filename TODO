[23:37:41] <Neil> if I have a wall endpoint selected and I 
create a new wall, have one endpoint be on the same 
position as the endpoint I already have selected
[23:38:41] <Neil> "degree measure" is fine, but draw an 
arrow
[23:34:47] <Neil> and puddles need a resize thing like 
slopes have
[23:34:26] <Neil> and hitting delete when I have a 
component of an element selected should delete the 
element
[23:32:49] <Neil> by the way, enabling the hole-selection 
arrows in edit mode would be nice
