Minor Bugs:
-----------
in edit mode it is possible to make a course with no cup

impossible 4, once you get the ball in the hole it skips the next two holes

impossible 4, send ball off edge of course and the hole moves!

need a max turn time, so that the ball isn't left bouncing off bumpers for ages (or possibly on some holes forever)

print needs fixing (see KolfGame::print)

balls can go through walls
	eg: classic 2, can get through connection with top diag and top wall (easliest from left)

if on your first turn (in a multiplayer game) for a hole you fall into water and choose "Rehit from last location" then your ball wall spawn on top of your opponents, so that when they make their first hit they will instantly collide with yours
	poss fix: check for collisions with ball and other balls when a player is making their first move.

balls can sometimes go through each other:
	go straigh in one dir with first player, then same with next and they will be able to go through opponent

minor info saving bug:
	start a game with two players with diff names
	end the game
	start a new game, and both players will have the name of the first

need to find a sound for getting a score below par, see game.cpp and find the line that contains:
	//playSound("woohoo");

apparently void KolfGame::startNextHole() needs tidying work since it is too complex (see game.cpp)

the names of menu items with checkboxs (eg in the Settings menu) seem wrong to me, need to think about what I want to change

slowness, bad performace, espeicially when in Xgl (at least on my system)
	
wrong player selected in score table at start of game

the edges of the course view should be hidden (or at least that is the way the levels are currently designed, see the margins in KolfGame::KolfGame

in strickt mode it is possible to select different holes, this is clearly cheating, but useful for debuging, so should be kept in for now

editing mode is very buggy and needs work, but probably best to wait till after the graphics upgrade

check if KolfGame::viewportToViewport() is still needed

layout of the big buttons at the top of window is wrong, needs thinking about

TIDYING TO DO WHEN SVG FULLY IMPLIMENTED:
-----------------------------------------
fix ball colours, probably need seperate balls

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
improve graphics

make slope darkness depend on slope angle again

use ball.advance() to give ball a spin animation?

give black holes an animation?

add resizing
