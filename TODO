Edit mode:
----------
need a more intuitive way to select create new, and need to start in edit mode

remove information on who's turn it is from the status bar when in edit mode

reszing is all broken

Minor Bugs:
-----------
Easy 6 - z order issues

hard 13, if the pusher pushes you into the hole the game thinks it is your shot, but you can't hit because you are in the hole

undo button not greyed out when undo impossible

when resizing make it so some pixmaps are not painted new every time (store size like in Katom?)

fix scoreboard resizing, it can get too big, and can also get too small!

USA Pro 7, text for Golden Gate displays incorrectly. And Washington DC should be on one line in hole 8

need to find a sound for getting a score below par, see game.cpp and find the line that contains:
	//playSound("woohoo");

apparently void KolfGame::startNextHole() needs tidying work since it is too complex (see game.cpp)

apparently KolfGame::shotDone() needs changing, since it says // do hack stuff, shouldn't be done here

the names of menu items with checkboxs (eg in the Settings menu) seem wrong to me, need to think about what I want to change

bad performace on levels with floaters. Also on the intro the ball seems to slow at the bottom of the first loop of the circular slope

wrong player selected in score table at start of game

in strict mode it is possible to select different holes, this is clearly cheating, but useful for debuging, so should be kept in for now

in edit mode it is possible to make a course with no cup

check if KolfGame::viewportToViewport() is still needed

layout of the big buttons at the top of window is wrong, needs thinking about

make slope arrows above sand? Only wants to be above sand, if that, this needs to be thought about. 

obscure load game crash, steps to reproduce:
1) load saved game
2) Save the game
3) End the game
4) click load game (in Game menu)
crash

auto save when editing needs to be implimented, in game.cpp see:
void KolfGame::autoSaveTimeout()

ball Collision is wrong, sometimes when you hit your opponents ball on the side it goes in the opposite direction of where you would expect it to go

check the pluginloader.cpp group is correct, see first for loop in loadAll


TIDYING TO DO WHEN SVG FULLY IMPLIMENTED:
-----------------------------------------
fix ball colours, probably need seperate balls

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
improve graphics

get new stuff option for kolf, not just for SVG graphics but also for courses (currently many storred on Jason Katz-Brown's website)

make slope darkness depend on slope angle again

use ball.advance() to give ball a spin animation?

give black holes an animation?
	ball falling into hole animation? (rather than just disappearing it coudl shrink to nothing)

have animations for the ball's interaction with sand and water?

fix appearance of large buttons (there are too many!) by only showing one of "New", "Save Course" or "End Game" at a time, since only one of them is ever appropriate. Also remove the Show info button and move to the Settings menu if more space is needed.
