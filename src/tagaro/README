This directory contains code from Project Tagaro, which has been copied into
the source tree of Kolf to ease porting to KGameRenderer, while Tagaro is not
stable.

The given code has been copied from the libtagaro repository, which was, at the
time of this writing, available from git://git.kde.org/libtagaro.git. The code
was taken from the directories tagaro/interface/ and tagaro/graphics/ at commit
a137e9b266dba51b3cb9fcbf32dd8a2a3a5976d5.

Code that integrates with Tagaro::MessageOverlay has been removed, and
Tagaro::Renderer and Tagaro::RendererClient have been replaced by KGameRenderer.
