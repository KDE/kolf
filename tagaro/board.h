 * @class Tagaro::Board board.h <Tagaro/Board>
 *
 * The Tagaro::Board is basically a usual QGraphicsItem which can be used to
 * group items. However, it has two special features:
 * @li It can adjust its size automatically to fit into the bounding rect of the
 *     parent item (or the scene rect, if there is no parent item). This
 *     behavior is controlled by the alignment() property.
 * @li When it is resized, it will automatically adjust the renderSize of any
 *     contained Tagaro::SpriteObjectItems.
